# Stake2Meet

Stake2Meet is a tool designed to help professionals ensure that their time is respected during scheduled meetings. By requiring participants to stake a small amount of ETH before booking, it creates a financial incentive to show up. 

If the participant attends, they get their ETH back; if they don't, the professional keeps the staked ETH as compensation for their time. 

This approach is great for consultants and professionals, reducing no-shows and preventing spammed calendar bookings without genuine commitment.
